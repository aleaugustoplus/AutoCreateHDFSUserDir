# Auto creation of user's home directory in HDFS

## These scripts are meant to create the automatically the user's home directory within hdfs filesystem once users log in into the client nodes 

* Copy FromHadoopProf.sh and hadoop.sh to /etc/profile.d/
* Make sure the user has privileges to create a /user/{username} directory

These files has to be placed in all client nodes

Enjoy :)
